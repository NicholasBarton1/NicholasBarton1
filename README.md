## Welcome 💪🐶
### I'm Nicholas Barton, an MIS student at the University of Georgia who is interested in all things data!


- 🔭 I’m currently working on finishing out school! I graduate in May 2026 and am looking forward to starting my next chapter in life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about data! I'm taking classes on Cloud Computing, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning, as well as studying Data Camp to begin working on person projects.
- 💬 Ask me about Formula 1 or UFC!
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me @ndbarton02@gmail.com

I am looking forward to expanding upon my skills and contributing to my page more in the future!
